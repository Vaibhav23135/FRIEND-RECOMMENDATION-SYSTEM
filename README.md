# Friend Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project integrates Machine Learning into a friend recommendation system, similar to those used in various social media platforms. Our goal was to enhance user experience by suggesting friends based on shared interests.

## Project Description
We developed a dummy website where users can sign up, log in, and find friends. To gather initial user data, we invited our classmates to participate. Upon account creation, users were required to fill out a form detailing their interests. These interests were stored in different fields for further processing.

Using this data, we trained a machine learning model to identify similarities among users. If a new userâ€™s interests matched those of existing users, our model recommended them as potential friends. This approach ensures personalized and meaningful friend suggestions.

## Features
- User authentication (Login/Signup)
- Interest-based profile creation
- Machine learning-based friend recommendations
- Dynamic matching of users based on shared interests

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

## How It Works
1. A user creates an account and logs in.
2. They fill out a form specifying their interests.
3. The system stores and processes the interest data.
4. A machine learning model analyzes similarities among users.
5. The system recommends users with matching interests.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve recommendation accuracy with deep learning techniques.
- Implement real-time friend suggestions.
- Integrate a chat feature for user interaction.
